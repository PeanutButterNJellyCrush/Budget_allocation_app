# Budget_allocation_app

## Overview
 ###The Budget Allocation App is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to help users optimize their monthly income through tailored budgeting and expense planning. 
The app calculates how users can best allocate their income across various expense categories by allocating remaining income after fixed expense have been deducted. It provides a visual breakdown of spending into categories displaying in table format and in a pie chart in .png format.

## Features
    **User Input**: Collects monthly income and fixed expenses from the user.
    **Budget Allocation**: Calculates the budget and allocates for various categories such as Savings, Investments, Dining Out, and Guilt-Free Spending post     expenses deductions.
    **Budget Visualization**: Displays formated budgeted in tables and a pie chart representing the budget breakdown.

    *Supports multiple calculations
    *Includes error handling and input validation

## Requirement:
    Before running the app, ensure you have the following installed:
        - **Python 3.x** (Recommended: Python 3.8+)
        The following Python libraries (can be installed using 'pip'):
            - 'matplotlib': For visualizing the budget allocation in a pie chart.

            - 'colorama': For terminal text formatting (used to display colorful output).
            - 'pyfiglet': For printing the app header in an ASCII art style.

        You can install these dependencies by running:
           ```bash
            pip install matplotlib tabulate colorama pyfiglet```
